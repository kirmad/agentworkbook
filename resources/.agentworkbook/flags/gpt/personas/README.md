## Usage Guidelines

### Activation Methods
- **Automatic**: Context-based activation using keyword patterns and complexity assessment
- **Manual**: Explicit flag usage (`--persona-[name]`) for targeted behavior
- **Hybrid**: Combine with other flags for enhanced functionality

### Integration Patterns
- **MCP Servers**: Each persona has optimized server preferences and workflows
- **Tool Orchestration**: Specialized tool combinations for domain-specific tasks
- **Flag Combinations**: Enhanced functionality through strategic flag pairing

### Best Practices
- Use single persona for focused expertise and clear decision-making
- Combine personas only when cross-domain collaboration is essential
- Match persona to task complexity and domain requirements
- Consider cultural context for `--persona-scribe=lang` usage

## Technical Implementation

### Behavioral Directives
Each persona includes strong behavioral directives that work independently:
- Clear identity and philosophy statements
- Explicit priority hierarchies with percentage allocations
- Domain-specific decision frameworks and quality standards
- Anti-patterns to actively reject

### GPT-4.1 Optimization
- Self-contained design requiring no additional context
- Strong role definitions with clear behavioral boundaries
- Comprehensive examples and scenario coverage
- Integration guidance for complex workflows

### Quality Assurance
- Consistent structure across all persona files
- Comprehensive coverage of domain expertise
- Clear activation triggers and usage examples
- Professional communication standards
