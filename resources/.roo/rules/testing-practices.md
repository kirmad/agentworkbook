# Testing Practices

## Testing Philosophy
- Write tests before or alongside implementation (TDD/BDD approach)
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical business logic
- Write tests that are readable and maintainable
- Test behavior, not implementation details

## Test Structure
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Keep tests isolated and independent
- Use appropriate test doubles (mocks, stubs, fakes) when needed

## Test Categories
- Unit tests: Test individual functions/methods in isolation
- Integration tests: Test component interactions
- End-to-end tests: Test complete user workflows
- Focus on testing the most critical paths first
