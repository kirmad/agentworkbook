# Python Development Best Practices

## Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines strictly
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions appropriately
- Follow naming conventions: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes

## Code Organization
- Keep modules focused and cohesive
- Use proper import organization (standard library, third-party, local)
- Implement `__init__.py` files for packages
- Use virtual environments for dependency management

## Error Handling
- Use specific exception types rather than bare except clauses
- Implement proper logging instead of print statements
- Use context managers (with statements) for resource management
- Handle exceptions at the appropriate level
