Perform systematic code refactoring focusing on:

## Code Quality Improvements
- Extract long methods into smaller, focused functions
- Eliminate code duplication (DRY principle)
- Improve variable and function naming for clarity
- Simplify complex conditional logic
- Remove dead or unreachable code

## Design Pattern Application
- Apply appropriate design patterns where beneficial
- Improve separation of concerns
- Enhance single responsibility principle adherence
- Reduce coupling between components
- Increase cohesion within modules

## Performance Optimization
- Identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks
- Optimize data structures and algorithms
- Reduce memory allocations and garbage collection pressure
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Optimize database queries and data access patterns

## Maintainability Enhancements
- Improve code documentation and comments
- Enhance error handling and logging
- Add type hints and interface definitions
- Improve test coverage for refactored code
- Update configuration and deployment scripts

## Safety Measures
- Ensure backward compatibility where required
- Implement comprehensive testing before and after changes
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout if needed
- Document all changes and migration steps
