Perform a comprehensive code review focusing on:

## Code Quality
- Check for adherence to coding standards and best practices
- Review function and variable naming conventions
- Assess code readability and maintainability
- Identify potential refactoring opportunities

## Security Analysis
- Look for common security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Check for proper input validation and sanitization
- Review authentication and authorization implementations
- Identify potential data exposure risks

## Performance Considerations
- Assess algorithm efficiency and complexity
- Look for potential bottlenecks or resource leaks
- Check database query optimization
- Review caching strategies

## Testing Coverage
- Verify adequate test coverage for new functionality
- Check for edge case handling in tests
- Review test quality and maintainability

Provide specific, actionable feedback with code examples where appropriate.
